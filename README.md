# Canny Edge Detection
<em>Project is in progress...</em>

 Edge Detection is a multi-stage algorithm to detect a wide range of edges in images. This technique is used to extract useful structural information from different vision objects and significantly reduce the amount of data to be processed. It is widely applied in various computer vision systems.
